Hi 
so this is my take on creating a portfolio page using ai tools 
i've used the v0.dev by vercel since that is the only page where i had my credits left 
overall loved the outcome

Sections to IncludeYour webpage must have the following 4 sections:HeaderLogo or NameNavigation links (Home, About, Skills, Contact)Hero SectionA headlineA short descriptionA “Contact Me” buttonSkills SectionList of at least 6 skills in a clean grid layoutFooterSocial media links
Responsiveness RequirementsYour webpage must be fully responsive:On desktop (≥1024px) → navigation links should appear in a row.On tablet (768–1023px) → hero text should reflow properly, grid becomes 2-column.On mobile (≤767px) →Hamburger menu or simple stacked navigationSkills section becomes 1-columnNo horizontal scroll allowed
